# generator-magentomodule [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mannebusk/generator-magentomodule.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mannebusk/generator-magentomodule)

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for Magento modules.


## Getting Started

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-magentomodule from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-magentomodule
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo magentomodule
```
Then simply answer the questions and thats it.
